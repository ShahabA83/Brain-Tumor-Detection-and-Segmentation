## In this project, we will perform tasks related to brain tumors in four stages using 2D MRI images.<br>
`Step 1:` We determine whether a tumor is present, which is done with about 98% accuracy<br>
`Step 2:` After determining the presence of a tumor, we determine the type of tumor, which is done with about 98% accuracy<br>
`Step 3:` We segment the tumor in the image, which is done with about 90% accuracy<br>
`Step 4:` We will find the tumor volume.<br>

The main project file is located in the `Final Code` folder, which contains all the steps.<br>
